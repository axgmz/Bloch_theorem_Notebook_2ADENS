Python notebook on Bloch's theorem and Wannier functions on polyacetylene: Bloch_Wannier.ipynb

It is part of the ENS chemistry department class on electronic structure (2A DENS) (Prof. R. Vuilleumier).

This work is an adaptation of notebooks by R. Vuilleumier on github: vuilleum/2ADENS-notebooks.

The notebook test.ipynb contains a minimal exemple to check that your python setup is sufficient to run Bloch_Wannier.ipynb. Requirements: python3, numpy, matplotlib and jupyter.

This notebook can be opened in Google Colab however it does not run there as wannier_toolbox.py is not available on Google Colab (you can copy everything from wannier_toolbox.py in a cell to patch this issue manually):
